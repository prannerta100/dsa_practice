When capacity overflows, the oldest element (first member of a list, let us say) has to be removed, but in O(1) time. We could have a doubly linked list such that each key points to a node of the linked list. We could delete and push the element accessed using get and put to the end of the list.

Although we know that if the median is the kth element of one array, then (n+m)/2-k in the second array have to be less than or equal to the kth element. If we overshoot the median mark, then this property will be violated. So in O(max(m,n)) time we could find the median point in each of the 2 arrays."

    "BUD: Trying every possible way to break a string up is very expensive. It is like partitioning an array into multiple parts. The answer is approximately a sum of n choose 0, n+1 choose 1, n+2 choose 2 and so on till 2n-1 choose n-1, which is exponential. Better to use dynamic programming. We define O(j) to be a boolean telling us if j to the end of the string can be broken up. To calculate O(j-1, n), we can use the following DP relation:\n",
    "O(j-1, n) = (O(j,n) & j-1:j in vocab) | (O(j+1,n)  & j-1:j+1 in vocab)| ... | (O(n-1,n) & j-1:n-1 in vocab)\n",
